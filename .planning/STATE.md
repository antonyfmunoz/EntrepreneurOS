## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Build as Claude Code skills using skill-creator — not a standalone app
- [Init]: Page-by-page Stitch generation (not full-app) — quality is better per page
- [Init]: Neon PostgreSQL for design memory — consistent with existing stack
- [Init]: First page always requires user approval — sets design anchor for consistency

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3 flag]: Stitch SDK is recent and evolving — pin version at install, test against live API early. Confidence scoring thresholds need empirical tuning (default: 15% drift tolerance, adjust after first real run).
